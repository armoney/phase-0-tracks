Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

	SELECT * FROM model;

Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

	UPDATE model SET year=1993 WHERE name="F1";

Display the information in both tables using one query.

	sqlite> SELECT *
	   ...> FROM model
	   ...> INNER JOIN make
	   ...> ON model.make_id=make.id
	   ...> ;

Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

	sqlite> SELECT model.name, model.year, make.name
	   ...> FROM model
	   ...> INNER JOIN make
	   ...> ON model.make_id=make.id;

Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

	DELETE FROM model WHERE name="F1";

DIFFERENT JOINS:

	SELECT make.name, model.name
	FROM model
	RIGHT JOIN make
	ON model.make_id=make.id;

	SELECT make.name, model.name
	FROM model
	LEFT JOIN make
	ON model.make_id=make.id;
