# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way of keeping track of changes to a file. It is useful because as a developer, records need to be kept on changes to files for reasons such as knowing where a problem was created, reverting back to an original version, or for timestamping changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of an original file that is used to edit the original content. Once the file is edited it can be mereged back to the original (master) file. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a documented change to a file. It lets the editor know what changes were made to the original with a concise statement.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when the same line of text is edited in different ways and mereged together.  Git doesn't know which is correct and a conflict is created.
