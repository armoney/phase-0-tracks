<h1>My Favorite Ohio Sports Teams</h1>
<h2>By Armon Arcuri</h2>

<p>I'm a guy who grew up in Ohio. In this Midwestern state, ball is life. Following sports is taken very seriously by almost every Ohioan you meet - maybe it's because there's not much else to do! Ohioans are passionate as fans go, and we look forward to all of the annual rivalries: </p>

<p>We have <em>a lot</em> of teams that we root for, both professional and collegiate (though it seems the college teams are treated as semi-pro). The following is a list of stand-out colleges:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> The Ohio State University</li>
        <li> University of Cincinnati</li>
        <li> Ohio University</li>
        <li> University of Toledo</li>
        <li> Kent State University</li>
        <li> Youngstown State University</li>
        <li> University of Akron</li>
    </ul>

<p>and professional teams:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Cleveland Browns</li>
        <li> Cincinnati Bengals</li>
        <li> Cleveland Indians</li>
        <li> Cincinnati Reds</li>
        <li> Cleveland Cavaliers</li>
        <li> Columbus Blue Jackets</li>
    </ul>

<p id="id"> My <strong>favorite</strong> sport is, by far, basketball follwed by football.  I'm more excited than ever about Ohio sports this year. The Cavaliers are going to take another shot at winning a championship after coming so close just last year.  The Ohio State University is currently in a great position to compete for a national title.  Of course, the Browns have their problems and the Indians are a .500 team but fans don't care.  Browns games are packed every week and baseball has a great history in Cleveland. It's hard to rank these teams, but here we go.  This is a list of my favorite Ohio teams: </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li> Cleveland Cavaliers basketball</li>
        <li> The Ohio State University football</li>
        <li> Cleveland Browns football</li>
        <li> The Ohio State University men's basketball</li>
        <li> Cleveland Indians baseball</li>
    </ol>

<p class="class"> As you might be able to tell, I didn't include any team from the other major sports city, Cincinnati.  While I do root for them, I've adopted Cleveland sports as my own. Having this many professional teams just goes to show you how much Ohioans love sports.  Maybe that's why Ohio is also the home of the National Football Hall of Fame (I'm sure all Ohio students have taken a field trip there).  Sure, Ohio sports has had its ups and downs, but just as <a href="http://www.lebronjames.com/post/category/theathlete">Lebron James</a> states on his social media, we have to continue to strive for greatness.  </p>

<p class="class">I decided to compare my page to a <a href="www.bieberfever.com">Justin Beiber fan page</a>.  I feel that it looks very professional, though it's no longer in use.</p>
