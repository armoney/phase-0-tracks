What sorts of resources will help? 

I have no idea, I'm going to Google search jquery.

I Googled jquery and the first link was for Codecademy.  So i spent 2 hrs on there and it was great. I know you said to use other resources to learn something but if the goal is to learn as much as possible in 2 hours then, seriously you're not going to do better than spending the entire 2 hours on Codecademy. 


How often should you stop and test what you just learned? 

I'll stop once I've lost all patience or if I find a good resource I'll spend, I don't know, an hour reading. 

Codecademy did a good job of testing what I've learned. 


Are breaks important?

Definitely. I took a small break every 1/2 hr.
